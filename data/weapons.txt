	description "A seemingly modified Proton Gun, the Dream Gun is a surprisingly small punchy weapon. Its small size is offset by its high energy consumption and high heat production. For some reason, crews in ships hit by dream projectiles will seemingly be in a dreary or drunk state, and their piloting capabilities highly affected."

	description "The Harrier is a ship that can fulfil most of a captain's needs. As well as acting as a freighter, the Harrier can be used as a mining ship. It can also boast 4 powerful Particle Cannons, making it a sort of glorified Quicksilver. However, despite its size, the Harrier lacks any turrets. In order to counteract this it has been fitted with generous amounts of engine space."

	description "When faced with the low amount of drones the Bulk Carrier could hold, Carbuncle toiled to make the deadliest drone ever seen. The Phage is that drone. With 5 gun ports, this little drone can pack quite the punch. It features the latest Carbuncle shield and hull technology, making it a fearsome ship to have by one's side. However, it comes with an high cost, making it a sort of premium product."
	description "	Drones do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a drone unless you have a ship in your fleet with a drone bay."
